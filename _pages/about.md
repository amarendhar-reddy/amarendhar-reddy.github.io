I am a Masters Graduate in Computer Science from University of North Texas, , where I gained a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and programming languages. I am passionate about web development and always eager to learn new skills and tools to enhance my performance and deliver innovative solutions. I have multiple certifications in data processing, software engineering, and software development, demonstrating my competence and commitment in the field.

As a Java Full Stack Developer, I participated in various phases of the software development lifecycle, using Agile methods and attending scrum meetings. I leveraged my expertise in Angular, Spring Boot, SQL Server, and other technologies to design and develop web applications that met the client's needs and expectations. I also implemented server-side logic, executed unit tests, and worked with Jenkins CI/CD tools to ensure quality and efficiency.
